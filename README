				WWW::Robot Module
				     v0.010

This distribution contains a module which provides a web traversal engine
for use in web robots and the like. The module will eventually be released
via CPAN, but for now it is a limited release beta cycle, to get feedback.

To install these modules, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make install

The module is documented using pod. When you "make install", you
will get a man-page: WWW::Robot. You can also generate HTML using pod2html:

	% pod2html Robot.pm

There is a simple example robot, poacher, in the examples/ directory of
this distribution. Poacher is a basic site validation robot, mainly to
illustrate use of the module.

Please let me know if you experience any problems with this module,
or have any ideas for additions.
